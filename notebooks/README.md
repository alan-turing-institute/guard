# GUARD Notebooks

The notebooks in this directory give examples of how to use the guard module.
Furthermore, they allow users to reproduce the data and figures presented in
[Madge et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11729).

## old_world

A replication of the original old world simulation by [Turchin et al.
(2013)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1308825110). Here, the mean imperial
density for three eras (1500 BC-500 BC, 500 BC-500 AD and 500 AD-1500 AD) are
determined and correlated with the historical imperial densities calculated by
Turchin. The same data is present in table 1 and figure 1 of [Madge et al.
(2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11729).

## population_correlation

Correlation of the simulation imperial density against a map of historical
populations. This notebook can be used to reproduce the plots in figure 3 of
[Madge et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11729).

## battles_correlation

Correlation of attack events in the simulation within Europe, and the historical
battles data set. This corresponds to figure 4 in [Madge et al.
(2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11729).

## roman_empire_comparison

Analyses polity sizes within the extend of the Roman empire at a series of
centuries. Histograms of the number of polities of a given size, and number of
cells within polities of each size are plotted corresponding to figure 2 in
[Madge et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11729).
